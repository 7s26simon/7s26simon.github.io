    <h2>Enumeration</h2>
    
    <p>I started with nikto, nmap and dirb. Nmap found ftp/ssh/http and dirb found an /assets folder. I figured I had enough to begin, so I got going.</p> 
    
    <p>There were two files in the assets folder. A link to a rickroll video, and a style.css file. I looked at the style.css and found it to contain a link to a php file, hinting that it contained a flag.</p>
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/css.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300">
    
    <p>When browsing to the super secret flag, it suggested that javascript should be turned off:</p>
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/3.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300">
    
    <p>After turning off JS, I refreshed the page:</p>
        
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/turnoffjs.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300">
    
    <p>I did as it asked and kept my volume up. Approx 1 min into the video, it said I was looking in the wrong place and that I should use *burp sound*</p>
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/rickrolled.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300">

    
    <p>I figured up burpsuite and browsed back to the previous directory. I then browsed forward again (with JS back on) and noticed there was a callout to a secret directory that had not been displayed anywhere so far.</p>

    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/4.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300">
    
    <p>That was all the enumeration needed in order to start making some serious progress.</p>
    
    <h2>Getting user</h2>

    <p>I browsed to the hidden directory and saw a PNG file titled "Hot_Babe.png". The file didn't have anything written onto the image itself...</p>
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/6.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300">
    
    <p>However, running "strings" on the file produced some very interesting results:</p>

    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/7_strings_ftp.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300">
    
    <p>The ftp user was "ftpuser" (do'h, should have guessed). But the password was one of the ones listed in the file. I created a file containing all of the passwords and ran it through hydra:</p>
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/8.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300">
    
    <p>Next up, I looked into FTP, listed the files and pulled them to my local attacker machine:</p>
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/9_ftp.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300">

    <p>This led to the following encoded text file:</p>
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/10_get_file.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300">
    
    <p>This was brainf*ck encoded JS (that's legitimately what it's called. I know...ghastly!)</p>
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/11_creds.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300"> 
    
    <p>I used the above creds to log in via SSH.</p>

    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/12_eli_login.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="300">
        
    <p>As above, I was logged in as eli and the login message suggested that there was a "s3cr3t" hiding place. I was unable to read the user.txt file in gwendoline's home directory, so I used the locate command to quickly find where it was on the file system:</p>
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/13_user_txt.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="150">
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/14_locate.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="150">    
    
    <p>Reading the secret message displayed another password. This was the password for gwendoline.</p>
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/15_gwen_creds.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="150"> 
    
    <p>Now, logged in as gwendoline, I looked at what she could run without a password:</p>
    
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/16_su_gwen.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="150">
     
    <h2>Getting root</h2>
    
    <p>The (ALL, !root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi looked very suspect. I decided to focus on this.</p>
    
    <p>I checked what version of sudo was running and it was 1.8.10, which meant it was vulnerable to <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47502" target="_blank">CVE-2019-14287</a></p>
        
    <img src="images/year_of_the_rabbit/18_priv_esc.JPG" alt="tryhackme" height="250">
    
    <p>I ran the command as -u#-1 (aka root) and managed to get a root shell, using:<br><br>:set shell=/bin/sh<br>
:shell <br><br>once inside vi. I was now root and could read the flag in /root. Excellent machine! Really got me thinking.</p>
